# mf-Lox

This is the result of me following Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters". I call it "mf-lox" because the design and implementation are quite different. I should confess that most of those differences are unintentional and the result of me realizing something a bit too late and not wanting to go back and make fundamental changes. But I'm mostly happy with what I have right now. Of course there is still some work to do. Error handling needs some work and I still have to implement a GC.
