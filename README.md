This is the result of me following Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters".The design and implementation are quite different. Most of those differences are unintentional and the result of me realizing something a bit too late and not wanting to go back and make fundamental changes. But I like what I have right now. Of course there is still a lot of work to do. There are some important bugs that need to be fixed and some features that need to be added.
